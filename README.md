# user-ms-api
A basic (CRUD) user management API.

- Make sure NODE and NPM is installed on your machine.
- Make sure MongoDB is installed, setup and running.
- In the root directory type 'npm install'
- To start the API, in the root directory type 'node api.js'
- If you want to reload everytime you save the project, I recommend using nodemon.
  - npm install --save nodemon
  - nodemon
